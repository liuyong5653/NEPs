## Simple Summary

A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.

We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. We provide for simple smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.

This standard is inspired by the ERC-721 token standard.

## Specification

### Meta Data

| Item | Description | Behaviors/Properties |
|:-|:-|:-|
| name | A descriptive name for a collection of NFTs in this contract | can not be changed |
| symbol | An abbreviated name for NFTs in this contract | can not be changed |
| tokenURI | A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset  |  |
| owner | contract deployer, mint NFTs |  |

### Interaction / Functions / Event

| Function | Description | Behaviors/Properties |
|:-|:-|:-|
| mint |  mint a new token | permission: owner |
| transferOwnership |  Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`) | permission: owner |
| transferFrom | Transfer ownership of an NFTs | permission: current owner, an authorized operator, or the approved address for this NFT |
| safeTransferFrom | Transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address | permission: current owner, an authorized operator, or the approved address for this NFT |
| approve | Change or reaffirm the approved address for an NFT | permission: NFT owner |
| setApprovalForAll | Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of `msg.sender`'s assets| |
|**Query**|
| balanceOf | Count all NFTs assigned to an owner |  |
| ownerOf | Find the owner of an NFT | |
| getApproved | Get the approved address for a single NFT | |
| isApprovedForAll | Query if an address is an authorized operator for another address | |
|**Event**|
| OwnershipTransferred | ownership of the contract to a new account |  |
| Transfer | This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism |  |
| Approval | This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or reaffirmed |  |
| ApprovalForAll | This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner |  |

## Test Cases

TBD

## Implementation
