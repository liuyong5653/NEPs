This is the suggested template for NewOrg NRC-12.

## Simple Summary

NewOrg template standard represents the living organization in newton ecosystem and a new DAO paradigm for the next generation social governance and collaboration.

## Abstract

NewOrg methods and standard based on NewChain and smart contract technologies are defined as is:
1. based on NewChain and its smart contract technologies.
2. to replace the traditional limited corporation with new governance paradigm based on blockchain technologies.
3. to define a set of meta rules for organization governance, and clarify the separation of these rules between NewChain layer and contract layer to implement: (1) business irrelative meta rules; (2) flexibility of neworg governance token; (3) anchoring all neworg to NewChain.
4. compatible with staking nodes as well as NewForce incentivization model in current NewPay for easier migration.
5. a complete open standard for any organization, institution, goverments to create NewOrg and transfer the centralized trust to the decentralized infrastructure and trust.

## Motivation

To replace the traditional limited corporation with new governance paradigm based on blockchain technologies, illustrated as below:

| orgStatus | the org status | freeze/unfreeze |

## Issues

- Q: Should it be allowed to create org without defining org token?
	* A: It depends on the concreate product implementation.

- Q: Should it be allowed to create asset tokens without linking with an org token?
	* A: It depends on the concreate product implementation.

## Rationale

## Asset Token Matrix

Possible asset tokens could be formulated with the following Boston matrix:

## Test Cases
TBD

## Implementation
